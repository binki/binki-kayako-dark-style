A dark style for Kayako.

## Goals

The goal is to provide an “OLED Dark” theme for Kayako (background is true black) which works when Kayako is used without any special settings (i.e., if Kayako ever provides dark mode, no need to manually turn it on in settings).

## Development

Please use the issue tracker to report any issues you encounter. This will allow coordination of any development efforts.

This is a work in progress. It is good enough for my daily use, but there are definitely improvements that can be made. I will try to accept any merge requests as long as they do not regress functionality I rely on and as long as they align with the project’s goals.
